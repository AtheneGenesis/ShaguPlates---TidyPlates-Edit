Aggro indicator for every hostile players and NPCs (if they have a raidmarker because of shared names) when someone in your party/raid is targeting it, even if they don't use this Addon. Aggro indicator is always accurate for your target nameplate.

Haven't touched this addon since I quit the now-disgusting vanilla private scene over a year ago, don't expect much updates from me.
